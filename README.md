# 1285

Monome grid-based sequencer take on the M185 sequencer by [RYK modular](https://rykmodular.bigcartel.com/products), also inspired by the [m18s script by jlmitch5](https://github.com/jlmitch5/m18s).

* Two voices of up to 8 steps, each step having up to 8 stages. 
* Notes are quantized to a scale of choice, and glide can be set per step. 
* The sequencer can play forward, in reverse, ping-pong or random. 
* Several play-modes for the stages of each step: all, none, first, every second, every third, every fourth, random.

## Requirements
* Norns
* Grid (128 varibright)
* Crow
